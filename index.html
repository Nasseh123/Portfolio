            <h2 class="tro"><u>ABOUT ME</u></h2>
            <p>I have been a professional programmer in one sense or another since I graduated from KCA University in 2019.  My undergraduate degree was a 
                BS in information Technology,
                 and I fully intended to design hardware, but the work that I gravitated to involved programming embedded microprocessors.  To further my
                  education, I attended night school at the Computer Pride at CBD Naiobi, where I learned the valuable lesson that the best teachers 
                  aren't necessarily found at the most prestigious Universities.  I earned my Various Certifications in Database Administration and 
                  basic COding in various programmin languages while working full time... 
                  and quite frankly I think most folks should do likewise. Without the "real world" providing perspective it's way too easy to get caught up in
                   theories about how to write good software that aren't really very practical.

                Most of my work has in one way or another related to making things easier for people who use computers - both for the end users and for programmers 
                (my work with  IBM's Lombardi Edition  today).  Over the course of my career software 
                development has moved from deep within the realm of experts to approaching the realm of just about everyone... My passion is to encourage that
                trend in every way that I can.</p>
