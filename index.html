            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I have been a professional programmer in one sense or another since I graduated from Rice University in 1980.  My undergraduate degree was a BS in Electrical Engineering, and I fully intended to design hardware, but the work that I gravitated to involved programming embedded microprocessors.  To further my education, I attended night school at the University of Texas at Arlington, where I learned the valuable lesson that the best teachers aren't necessarily found at the most prestigious Universities.  I earned my MS in Computer Science and Engineering while working full time... and quite frankly I think most folks should do likewise. Without the "real world" providing perspective it's way too easy to get caught up in theories about how to write good software that aren't really very practical.

                Most of my work has in one way or another related to making things easier for people who use computers - both for the end users (my work on Tandy's DeskMate back in the 80s) and for programmers (my work with  IBM's Lombardi Edition  today).  Over the course of my career software development has moved from deep within the realm of experts to approaching the realm of just about everyone... My passion is to encourage that trend in every way that I can.</p>
